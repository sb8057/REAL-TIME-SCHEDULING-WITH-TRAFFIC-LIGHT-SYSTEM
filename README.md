ABSTRACT
Real-time scheduling is a critical aspect of operating systems and embedded systems, where tasks and processes have strict timing requirements. Real-time scheduling ensures that time-critical tasks, such as sensor data processing or industrial control, are executed within their deadlines. It guarantees predictability, low latency, and minimal system response time, making it essential for applications where timing precision is paramount, even at the expense of overall system utilization. Real-time scheduling techniques prioritize tasks based on deadlines, ensuring that the most time sensitive operations are executed first, preventing missed deadlines and system failures. The "Real-Time Simulator for Process Scheduling in Operating Systems" project fulfills a crucial need for a dependable tool to model and assess the performance of real-time scheduling algorithms, including Round Robin, Shortest Job Next (SJN), and First Come First Serve (FCFS). Designed to emulate multitasking operating systems within stringent time constraints, this simulator empowers users to dynamically define real-time tasks with specific deadlines, execution times, and priority levels. The platform provides a user-friendly graphical interface for task input, simulation initiation, and result visualization. Additionally, it offers comprehensive analysis tools to evaluate task set feasibility and computes vital performance metrics such as CPU utilization, response times, and deadline miss ratios. This project caters to developers, engineers, students, and researchers involved in safety critical applications, providing a controlled environment to assess real-time system behavior and aiding in the design and validation of scheduling strategies for specific domains.
